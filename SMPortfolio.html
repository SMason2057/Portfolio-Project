		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<section class="bio">
			<p>
				Hello there! I'm glad you've decided to stop by and visit my page. My name is 
				Shauna Mason and I am a completely normal human being. In addition to being a 
				human, I love video games, puzzles, coding, and most importantly cats (I like dogs
				as well, but not as much as cats). 
				
				I graduated from Valencia College with an A.S. degree a couple of years ago and I am now 
				currently attending the <span>University of Central Florida</span> and working 
				towards my B.S. degree in Information Technology (IT). Besides being a student, 
				I also work at my college for the Center of Distributed Learning (CDL). 
				My main role is to ensure that the online content for courses is accessible for students
				who have disabilities. To find out more just skip on down to the <span> resources</span>
				section to take a look at my <span>resume.</span> 
				
				Although I am majoring in IT, I have fallen into web development. I have dabbled in 
				the world of web for a few of my courses at Valencia, but it never really caught my interest. 
				
				
				In Scannable, by way of comparison, you simply tap one button to save 
				the scanned card to your phone contacts. That makes Scannable the better
				option for those looking mainly for a business card scanner, while Office 
				Lens is really about catering to the heavy OneNote using crowd instead.

			<p>I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for an expert in cat wrangling, 
			   you have come to the wrong place. But, what I do have are a very particular set of skills, 
		       skills that I have acquired over a period of time. Skills that may be valuable for a company like yours. 
			   If you don't want to look any further, that'll be the end of it. You won't have to contact me, you won't 
			   have to pursue me. But if you do want to continue on, and you decide to leave your contact information,
			   I will look for you, I will find you, and I will work with you.
