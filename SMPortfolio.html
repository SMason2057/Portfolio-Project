				Hello there! I'm glad you've decided to stop by and visit my page. My name is 
				Shauna Mason and I am a completely normal human being. In addition to being a 
				human, I love video games, puzzles, coding, and most importantly cats (I like dogs
				as well, but not as much as cats). 
				
				I graduated from Valencia College with an A.S. degree in Information Technology a couple of years ago and I am now 
				currently attending the <span>University of Central Florida</span> and working 
				towards my B.S. degree. Besides being a student, 
				I also work at my college for the Center of Distributed Learning (CDL). 
				My main role is to ensure that the online content for courses is accessible for students

				section to take a look at my <span>resume.</span> 
				
				Although I am majoring in IT, I have fallen into web development. I have dabbled in

			<p>I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for an expert in cat wrangling,

		       skills that I have acquired over a period of time. Skills that may be valuable for a company like yours. 
			   If you don't want to look any further, that'll be the end of it. You won't have to contact me, you won't 
			   have to pursue me. But if you do want to continue on, and you decide to leave your contact information,
			   I will look for you, I will find you, and I will work with you.
